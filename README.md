## Usage
Go to [the website hosted on Netlify](https://whoseturn.netlify.app). Creating new rooms is recommended only on PC.
Once you have created the room, share the id with your players and have them join you. They will be able to insert themselves to initiative order, or claim
one of the non-hidden characters. Then, whenever you update initiative, it will update for your players in real time.

## Build
This project was build using React and websockets. Server code is just a simple socket.io server. This is the first full JavaScript project that I have published.
